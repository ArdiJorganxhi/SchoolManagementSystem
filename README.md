# SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This is a school management API for students, teachers to manage courses, grades, GPA, and other operations happening within a school management system. 

Students can enroll to courses or unenroll from them, view their grades, course calendar, internships, GPA, semester and total credits. Their semester credits will be updated automatically after their enroll to course and if they become successful, their total credits will be updated too.

Teachers can create, update and delete courses, they can grade students' midterm, finalExam and their final grade letter of course. 

Also secretaries are able to manage only internship operations.

This API isn't developed semester-based, so think of it as only one semester for every operation you will try in API.
